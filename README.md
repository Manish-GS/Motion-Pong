# Motion-Pong

## A project built using Verilog and the Altera DE2-115 Development Board.
Motion Pong will utilize the DE2 board, as well as two different ultrasonic sensors, to not only allow players to play the good old fashioned game of Pong but to enable players to utilize simple hand gestures to control their in-game movements.

Players will be able to use the distance between their hands and the sensors to do this, moving their hands towards and away from the sensors to move the game paddle up and down respectively, thus, adding another layer of interaction between them and the game they all know and love.
